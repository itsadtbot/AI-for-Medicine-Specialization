# AI-in-Medicine-Specialization
AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, 
and recommend better treatments. This three-course Coursera Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai has given me practical experience 
in applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine.

There are three courses.

1. AI for Medical Diagnosis
2. AI for Medical Prognosis
3. AI for Medical Treatment
